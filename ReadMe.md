## Contraction mapping and non-convex optimization

The weak contraction mapping is a self mapping that the range is always a subset of the domain,
which admits a unique fixed-point. The iteration of weak contraction mapping is a Cauchy sequence
that yields the unique fixed-point. A gradient-free optimization method as an application of weak
contraction mapping is proposed to achieve global minimum convergence. The optimization method
is robust to local minima and initial point position.

## Sturm-Liouville equation for two-body system 

We introduce a Sturm-Liouville equation derived from Newtonâ€™s law to describe the dynamical system of the two-body system under the influence of torque. In the paper, we present conic sections and the Bohr model are solutions of the equation. Moreover, the logarithm spiral can be the solution as well and the complex solutions are able to form the basis of Hilbert space.
