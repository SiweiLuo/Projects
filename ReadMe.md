## Contraction mapping and non-convex optimization

The weak contraction mapping is a self mapping that the range is always a subset of the domain,
which admits a unique fixed-point. The iteration of weak contraction mapping is a Cauchy sequence
that yields the unique fixed-point. A gradient-free optimization method as an application of weak
contraction mapping is proposed to achieve global minimum convergence. The optimization method
is robust to local minima and initial point position.
